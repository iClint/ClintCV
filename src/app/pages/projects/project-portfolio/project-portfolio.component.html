      I have deliberately kept the design minimalistic, focusing on usability
      and performance, and avoided the use of third party libraries even where
      it might have been easier to do so. some examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout instead of a UI framework.
      </li>
      <li>
