      I worked as part of the WooliesX engineering team on the Order Tracking
      Portal, used by customers nationwide to track grocery deliveries in real
      time. While the project was a collaborative effort, I was specifically
      responsible for designing and building many of the user interface
      components, ensuring they were accessible, responsive, and aligned with
      Woolworthsâ€™ design system.
