        I’m Clint — a fullstack software engineer who builds scalable,
        performant web applications across Angular, .NET, and Azure. I care
        deeply about clean architecture, user experience, and delivering
        real-world outcomes — without the bloat or bullshit.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey into tech started in the 90s, coding in BASIC on a beige-box
        8086. I studied Computing Studies through high school, but life took me
        elsewhere. I ran a Cash-in-Transit business for over a decade before a
        serious accident (and a global pandemic) forced a rethink.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pivoted fast — taking a role in Woolworths Online, where I honed my
        customer skills and quick thinking under pressure. My curiosity pulled
        me toward WooliesX, and I started building a portfolio on the side to
        prove I belonged. I was selected as one of 12 candidates (out of 100+)
        for a WooliesX pilot program into fullstack engineering. After an
        intense 12-week bootcamp, I landed my first official tech role.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days I write better code, ship smarter features, and work toward
        scalable frontend/backend systems. I value stateless components, useful
        tests, and clear commit messages. I don’t do cargo cult patterns or
        endless meetings — I just get things done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m usually flying simulated helicopters in MSFS,
        tuning my home lab, or questioning whether I really need a sixth
        monitor. (Spoiler: I do.)
