    <!-- TL;DR: Your hook -->

      <h2>The TL;DR</h2>
      <p>
        I solve problems with code, caffeine, and occasionally duct tape. I
        architect performant real-time systems, build scalable UIs, and obsess
        over UX and delivery velocity.

      <h2>Key Projects</h2>
      <p>
        As a core contributor to Woolworthsâ€™ Order Tracking Portal, I helped
        rebuild the platform into a high-performance Angular 18 SPA that
        delivers real-time order updates at national scale. My work spanned
        design system integration, platform optimization, and reactive
        architecture.

      <ul class="achievement-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Core Design System Alignment:</strong> Integrated token-based
          design system elements, balancing accessibility with rapid development
          velocity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform Refactor & Optimisation:</strong> Modularized logic,
          stateless component design, lazy loading, and significant performance
          gains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-time Driver Rating:</strong> Delivered reactive driver

    <!-- How you work -->

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        Pragmatic, product-focused, Agile-native. I value clean commits, fast
        feedback loops, and shipping useful features without drama. Daily
        standups, sprint retros, and clean Jira boards are second nature.
