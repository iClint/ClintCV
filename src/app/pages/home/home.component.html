      <h2>The TL;DR</h2>
      <p>
        I solve problems with code, caffeine, and occasionally duct tape. I’ve
        architected and built real-time systems, component libraries, and
        tracking portals with obsessive attention to UX and performance.

      <h2>Past Achievements</h2>
      <ul class="achievement-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Order Tracking Portal – Woolworths:</strong>
          Rebuilt the entire platform from a static microfrontend to a
          high-performance Angular 18 SPA. Implemented real-time updates via
          event streams, optimized for both speed and scalability, and delivered
          a seamless experience across millions of orders.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>UI Uplift with Core Design System:</strong>
          Integrated and aligned the app with WooliesX’s core design system,
          replacing legacy components and styles with accessible, consistent,
          and token-driven UI elements — without blocking development velocity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Refactor & Streamlining:</strong>
          Reduced technical debt across key components and services. Modularized
          business logic, introduced stateless components, improved lazy
          loading, and cut load time by shaving off redundant data fetches and
          change detection overhead.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Real-time Driver Rating Initiative:</strong>
          Designed and implemented a real-time driver feedback feature.
          Delivered observable-driven UX, clean component architecture, and
          end-to-end test coverage with Cypress. Took it from concept to
          production under tight deadlines.

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I thrive in Agile environments — whether it’s fast-paced sprints with
        Scrum or continuous flow using Kanban. I’m no stranger to daily
        stand-ups, retros, or navigating a Jira board with 57 open tabs. I value
        clean commits, honest feedback, and getting things shipped without
        drama.
